| **Images** | Public (ghcr.io, Docker Hub) | Zendis (registry.opencode.de, requires auth) |
| **Portal** | Custom Rust/Axum portal | None (services accessed directly) |
| **Monitoring** | dev-agent, predictive-agent, ollama, taskfleet | None |
| **PostgreSQL** | 17-alpine, production tuning, PgBouncer | 15.13-alpine, SOHO tuning, per-service DBs/users |
| **Redis** | 7-alpine, AOF + RDB persistence | 7.4.3, no persistence (volatile cache) |
| **Mail** | Stalwart v0.16 with entrypoint template | Stalwart latest, static config |
| **Groupware** | SOGo with LDAP | SOGo with Casdoor OIDC |

| **Extra services** | None | Invoice Ninja, Paperless-ngx, Gotenberg, CryptPad, Synapse, Element-Web, Notes/Impress |
| **DB init** | 2 databases (zitadel, sogo) via SQL | 7 databases with separate users via shell script |
| **Coexist** | `demo.coexist.yml` (piggyback on existing Traefik) | `docker-compose.test.yml` (port remapping) |

## What to Take from vhrz2392

### 1. Profile-Based Architecture
vhrz2392 uses `--profile` flags (e.g., `--profile office`) instead of `COMPOSE_FILE` overlays. This is cleaner — services stay in one `docker-compose.yml`, profiles enable/disable them. Our overlay approach requires remembering file order.

**Decision**: Adopt profiles as an **alternative** to overlays. Keep overlays for backward compatibility but add profile support.

### 2. Makefile with Test Pyramid
vhrz2392 has a comprehensive Makefile with:
- Layer 0: Static validation (shellcheck, yamllint, compose config, env check, secret scan)
- Layer 1: Host tuning (Ansible dry-run)
- Layer 2: Container health
- Layer 3: Smoke tests (HTTP/SSL/port)
- Layer 4: Integration tests (OIDC, email, API)
- Layer 5: E2E (Playwright)
- Layer 6: Security audit

**Decision**: Adopt the Makefile with test pyramid. Adapt for our service names and IAM (Zitadel instead of Casdoor).

### 3. Tier-Based Resource Profiles
vhrz2392 has `soho` (4c/8G), `small` (8c/24G), `medium` (16c/48G) tiers that auto-select profiles and set resource limits.

**Decision**: Adopt tier system. Our `demo.dev` and `demo.live` are similar but less structured.

### 4. Additional Services
vhrz2392 has services we lack:
- **Invoice Ninja** — invoicing for SMEs
- **Paperless-ngx** — document management with OCR
- **Gotenberg** — PDF conversion API (companion to Paperless)
- **CryptPad** — collaborative document editing (lighter than Collabora)
- **Synapse** — Matrix chat server
- **Element-Web** — Matrix web client
- **Notes/Impress** — collaborative note-taking with MinIO S3

**Decision**: Add these as optional profiles. They're valuable for a complete SME platform.

### 5. Separate Networks
vhrz2392 uses `traefik-frontend` (public) + `backend` (internal). Only Traefik and labeled services are on `traefik-frontend`. Our single `opendesk-net` means all services can be exposed.

**Decision**: Adopt two-network model. More secure.

### 6. Volume-Level Backup/Restore
vhrz2392's `backup.sh` stops services, backs up each volume individually, combines into a single tar.gz, and has `--dry-run` and `--services` options. Our backup only dumps PostgreSQL + Traefik ACME.

**Decision**: Adopt volume-level backup with dry-run support. Keep PostgreSQL dump as well.

### 7. Per-Service Database Users
vhrz2392 creates separate PostgreSQL users for each service (casdoor_user, synapse_user, opencloud_user, etc.) with their own passwords. Our init creates only `zitadel` and `sogo` databases.

**Decision**: Adopt per-service database users for better isolation.

### 8. Casdoor as Lightweight IAM Option
Casdoor is 128 MB vs Zitadel's 512 MB. For small deployments, Casdoor may be preferable.

**Decision**: Keep Zitadel as default, add Casdoor as an alternative `idm/casdoor.yml` overlay for lightweight deployments.

## What to Keep from contextual-intelligence.org (master)

### 1. Zitadel as Primary IAM
Zitadel has better enterprise features (machine keys, service accounts, OIDC flows). Keep as default.

### 2. PgBouncer
Connection pooling is essential for high-load PostgreSQL. Keep.

### 3. OpenCloud with S3/MinIO
Decomposeds3 storage is more scalable than local storage. Keep.

### 4. Collabora
Full office editing is more powerful than CryptPad alone. Keep.

### 5. Monitoring Overlays
AI-powered health monitoring is unique to our deployment. Keep.

### 6. Coexist Profile
Piggybacking on existing Traefik is essential for shared hosts. Keep.

### 7. Rust Portal
Custom portal provides a landing page. Keep.

### 8. Stoic Unix Philosophy
Each file does one thing well. Keep the modular structure.

### 9. Comprehensive README and .env.example
Our documentation is more thorough. Keep.

### 10. demo.dev and demo.live Profiles
Separate dev and live configs. Keep.

### 11. Stalwart with Entrypoint Template
Config rendering from template is more flexible than static config. Keep.

### 12. SOGo with LDAP
LDAP integration for user management. Keep.

### 13. Production PostgreSQL Tuning
Our tuning (shared_buffers=1GB, etc.) is more production-ready. Keep.

### 14. Redis with Persistence
AOF + RDB is safer than volatile cache. Keep.

### 15. Health Checks on All Services
Every service has a healthcheck. Keep.
