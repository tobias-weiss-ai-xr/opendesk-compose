# Service Specifications

Each YAML file in this directory declares the **expected state** of services
in a compose overlay. The test harness (`tests/01-specs/validate_specs.py`)
parses every compose file and verifies it matches its spec.

## Spec format

```yaml
services:
  <service-name>:
    image: <image:tag>           # expected image (or null for build)
    compose_file: <path>         # which compose file defines this service
    required: true               # must be present in the compose file
    profiles: ["invoice"]        # Docker Compose profiles (empty/omit = always)
    host_ports: [80, 443]        # ports exposed to the host (empty = internal only)
    healthcheck: true            # must define a healthcheck
    networks: [opendesk-net]     # expected networks
    volumes:                     # expected volumes
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    env: [POSTGRES_PASSWORD]     # required env vars (checked against .env.example)
    traefik_labels: true         # must have traefik.* labels
    resource_limits:             # deploy.resources.limits
      memory: 4G
    depends_on: [postgres]       # expected dependencies
```
